## Things we don't want to force people to consume need to be imported
## manually. Currently, that's:
##
## `logging`    because importing it sets up data structures that you might
##              not use; you should explicitly choose to import it.
## `managedtmp` because it adds a destructor you might not want.
## `randwords`  because it does have a huge data structure embedded, which
##              isn't worth it if you're not using it.
